Golf was played in Accra on about than five nine hole courses from the early part of the century.  While the Achimota course was relatively a late comer, it is the only one which has survived the building development which has changed Accra over some decades, from a sleepy centre of colonial Administration to the present busting commercial metropolis.</p>

There are also tennis courts and a well equipped fitness gym, which can also be used for a small fee. The driving range is a big field and golf balls are provided for the range. The big minus however is, that your caddy has to pick the balls up and bring them back. So not adviseable to use the range. There is no pro shop. There is a small terrace for drinks and food after or before the round. The caddies and the staff in general is very friendly.</p>
